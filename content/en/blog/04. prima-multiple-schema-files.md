## Why multiple schema's in a simple project

We are developing a sample Customer Portal application that other developer can use as a starting point for their own Customer Portal.
We want to create a few real life examples, such as service request, orders and invoices that showcases the soloutions ability.

We want to make it easy for other developers to remove the functionality they don't need.
That's why we are using [Nuxt's layer functionality](https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/getting-started/layers) to create a separate folder for each functional area.

## Prisma schemas

We are using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/overview) as our ORM. Prisma typically uses only one schema file called schema.prisma 

That looks something like this:

```prisma
// prisma.schema
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

model User {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  email     String   @unique
  name      String?
  role      Role     @default(USER)
  posts     Post[]
}

model Post {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  published Boolean  @default(false)
  title     String   @db.VarChar(255)
  author    User?    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  Int?
}

enum Role {
  USER
  ADMIN
}
```

You can generate the types and client code for this schema using the command `npx prisma generate`.
You can generate migrations using the command `npx prisma migrate dev --name <name>`

By default this will generate the files in the node_modules/@prisma, a practice that is now deprecated: you should generate the output to a folder in your project (excluding it from source control) like this:

```
// prisma.schema
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  output   = "./generated/client"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

This will generate the code in a structure like this:

```bash
prisma/
├── schema.prisma
└── generated/
    └── client/
        ├── index.js
        ├── index.d.ts
        └── ... (other generated files)
```

This works fine, and there is no additional configuration needed.

I wanted to add an additional prisma schema for my service-layer module, so I read the [Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/overview/location) and created the following structure:

```bash
prisma/
├── schema.prisma 
├── service-requests.prisma 
└── generated/
    └── client/
        ├── index.js
        ├── index.d.ts
        └── ... (other generated files)
```





```bash
prisma/
├── schema/
│   ├── schema.prisma
│   ├── user.prisma
│   └── post.prisma
├── migrations/
│   ├── <migration-timestamp>_<name>/
│   │   └── migration.sql
│   └── ...
└── generated/
    └── client/
        ├── index.js
        ├── index.d.ts
        └── ... (other generated files)
```

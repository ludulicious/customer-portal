## Another customer portal?

Why do we need another customer portal? There are many solutions on the market, and they all work fine.
But we think there must be a better way that's also not only accessible to big companies, but also to the smaller ones.
Our new customer portal will make it easy for you to create a new installation and add all the functionality that you need.

## Tech stack

- For the frontend and backend we use [Nuxt 4](https://nuxt.com/) in 1 project.
- For the UI we use [Nuxt UI](https://ui.nuxt.com/) which is based on Tailwind CSS and Headless UI
- For the database we use [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).
- For PostgreSQL hosting we use [Neon](https://neon.com/)
- As language we use TypeScript
- For the ORM we use Prisma.
- For authentication we use [better-auth](https://www.better-auth.com/)

We handle deployment via a Docker container on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
